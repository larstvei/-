* @

  ~@~ is a program that is used to execute a single command on a remote machine
  using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell][ssh]].

  The command:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ssh HOST echo test
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  will produce exactly the same result as:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  @ HOST echo test
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The ~@~ program introduces the ~@~ /operator/. When a file is prefixed by the
  ~@~ operator, the file should be transferred to the remote location before
  the command is executed.

** Example

   Assume you have a file called ~hello~ containing ~hello world!~ in the
   current directory. If we run the command:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   @ HOST cat @hello
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   the result will be:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   hello world!
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Notes

   ~@~ supports hosts specified in =~/.ssh/config=.

   If a command includes piping or redirections the command should be quoted:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   @ HOST 'cat @hello | rev'
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The result is:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   !dlrow olleh
   #+END_EXAMPLE
